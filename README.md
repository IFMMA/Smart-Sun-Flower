1 | Overview
This project keeps two small solar panels pointed at the brightest light source by comparing readings from four light-dependent resistors (LDRs) and moving two servos in horizontal (azimuth) and vertical (elevation) axes.
Perfect as a classroom demo or a starting point for full-size trackers.

## üîß Features
- Tracks sunlight in two axes using LDR sensors
- Moves panel using servo motors
- Real-time light sensing and adjustment
- Low-cost and scalable

4 | üìù How it Works
|        Block          |                             Purpose                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read sensors**      | Four `analogRead()` calls give light intensity (0-1023).         |
| **Average & compare** | Differences between top/bottom and left/right decide motion.     |
| **Move servos**       | If difference exceeds `tol`, increment or decrement angle by 1¬∞. |
| **Limits**            | Stops at predefined min/max to protect wiring.                   |

Key wiring points:

Arduino Pin        	Connected To	                 Purpose
   A0              	LDR - bottom-right        	Analog light input
   A1	              LDR - top-right	
   A2	              LDR - top-left	
   A3	              LDR - bottom-left	
   D2	              Servo 1 signal	           Horizontal (azimuth)
   D4               	Servo 2 signal	         Vertical (elevation)
   5V	              LDR + Servo Vcc	               Power rail
  GND	              LDR + Servo GND             	Common ground

Tip: If servos jitter when USB-powered, feed them from an external 5V supply (share GND with Arduino).
